The excess manufacturing capacity runs into the hundreds of millions of square feet of commercial, industrial and manufacturing space nationwide.

This information is critical to facilitate transactions with private sector companies to acquire sites and restart advanced manufacturing production. Also sorely lacking is a system through which manufacturers seeking production facilities can provide information about their needs and be matched to an appropriate facility.
